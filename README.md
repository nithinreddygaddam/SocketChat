# SocketChat iOS application runs with the Server-SocketChat repo


Change the IP address on SocketIOManager before you run.

Fetching IP Address:

type command 'ifconfig'

then in the terminal window you’ll see a long log regarding your network, but what you are looking for is an IP address in the form of 192.168.X.X if you’re on a local area network as shown next, or some other IP address if you’re not on a LAN.

Try not changing the port number unless it clashes with an other application.
